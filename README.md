### 9. Financial Projections & Funding Request

**9.1. Financial Model Assumptions**
*(High-level - Detailed model in Appendix)* Key drivers include: Phased client acquisition based on GTM plan, tiered ARPU growth as clients adopt more modules, target NRR >120% driven by upsell/expansion, churn rate <5% annually post-GA, COGS primarily driven by cloud hosting costs and support staff (~20-25% of revenue at scale), significant upfront R&D investment tapering as % of revenue post-GA, efficient S&M spend (LTV:CAC ratio > 4:1 target).

**9.2. ARR Projections & Revenue Breakdown (2025-2028)**
* **2025 (Post-Series B): $65M** (Primarily existing services revenue + initial IWOP setup/pilot fees)
* **2026 (Beta Expansion): $150M** (IWOP Beta subscription revenue ramps significantly, services revenue stable/slight decline)
* **2027 (GA Scale): $500M** (Strong IWOP SaaS adoption post-GA, increasing ARPU from module expansion)
* **2028 (Market Leadership): $1.5B** (Approaching target market share, full module suite contributing, potential international revenue starts)
    *(Revenue Breakdown: Target ~70% Subscription, ~20% Premium AMS Tiers, ~10% Analytics/Add-ons by 2028)*

**9.3. Gross Margin & Profitability Analysis**
Target **Gross Margin >75%** by 2027 as the SaaS model scales and economies of scale in hosting and support are realized. Expect negative EBITDA through the high-growth investment phase (2025-2027), reaching EBITDA breakeven/profitability projected in late 2028 or early 2029 as revenue scale outpaces operating expense growth.

**9.4. Series B Funding Request: $60 Million**
